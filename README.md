## AWS Managed Microsoft AD and Amazon Route 53 for DNS

This example CloudFormation template allows customers to create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD with Amazon Route 53. With Route 53, customers are able to send AD related queries to their Managed Microsoft AD environment without having to create a custom DHCP option set in their VPC. Customers also have the ability to create reverse DNS records for applications that require reverse DNS lookups.
